# Utility Dashboard created in React (WIP)

## Purpose
I wanted to create a single dashboard to easily access all necessary tools from one place rather than having multiple windows open on my desktop. Along the way, I am constantly improving on my React skills. It also has the added benefit of looking cool :)

## Technologies and Methods used
+ React js
+ State Management / React Hooks
+ JavaScript/JSX 
+ Sass for styling 
+ React Draggable

## Features 
This dashboard has multiple widgets for different tasks. All widgets are fully draggable across the viewport. 

### Currently Working
+ Clock
+ Pomodoro Timer 
+ Calculator
+ Animated Gradient Background
+ Embedded YT Player
+ Task Tracker (with local storage fucntionality)

### Pending Integration
+ Custom YT link functionality for player

### In the works 
+ Spotify player
+ Google Calendar Widget
+ Weather 

## Building Process
Under the hood, the dashboard is a collection of individual working components that encapsulate a widget. Some widgets require multiple components for better structure/formatting/sake of sanity. The directory structure represents this. 

## How to use

+ Clone the repository
+ Execute `npm run build`. This creates a build folder
+ Execute `npm install -g serve` if you do not have it installed already
+ Execute `serve -s build`. This will run the build in a local server.
